The Modal Layout app provides blocks that can help you create modals in your store.

## Configuration

1. Add the modal layout's app to your theme's dependencies in the `manifest.json`:

```diff
  "dependencies": {
+   "vtex.modal-layout": "0.x"
  }
```

Now, you are able to use all blocks exported by the `modal-layout` app. Check out the full list below:

| Block name | Description | 
| --------  | ------------ | 
| `modal-trigger` | ![https://img.shields.io/badge/-Mandatory-red](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Mandatory-red) Its child block defines how the Modal content will be triggered. | 
| `modal-layout` | ![https://img.shields.io/badge/-Mandatory-red](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Mandatory-red) Defines how the Modal content will be rendered. |
| `modal-actions` | Logical block only responsible for rendering its child blocks that, in turn, are responsible for rendering call-to-action buttons inside the modal, such as a close button. | 
| `modal-actions.close`  | Button that closes the modal when you clicked on. It is extremely useful in scenarios where your modal has a form or a disclaimer box providing information for users. |

2. Add the `modal-trigger` block in any store template of your choosing. In the example below, it will be added to the Home page: 

```jsonc
{
  "store.home": {
    "children": [
      "modal-trigger#example"
    ]
  },
```

3. Declare the `modal-trigger` block using its prop and configuring children blocks for it. The `modal-trigger`'s first children must be a block of your choosing to trigger the Modal content. Then, a sibling block called `modal-layout` will be needed to effectively define the Modal content through its child block list. For example:

```jsonc
{
  "store.home": {
    "children": [
      "modal-trigger#example"
    ]
  },
   "modal-trigger#example": {
    "children": [
      "rich-text#example",
      "modal-layout#example"
    ]
  },
  "rich-text#example": {
    "props": {
      "text": "Click me"
    }
  },
  "modal-layout#example": {
    "children": [
      "rich-text#modal-content"
    ]
  },
  "rich-text#modal-content": {
    "props": {
      "text": "Hello"
    }
  }
}
```

In the example above, the [Rich Text](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.rich-text/) block renders the `Click me` text that will trigger the Modal content when clicked on. 

The modal content, in turn, is defined by the `modal-layout` block. According to the example above, the Modal content triggered by the `Click me` Rich Text would be a `Hello` text. 

### `modal-trigger` props 

| Prop name | Type | Description | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `trigger` | `Enum` | Whether the Modal content should be triggered by user click ( `click`), when the page is fully loaded (`load`) or when the page is fully loaded but the modal will appears just once per session (`load-session`) | `'click'` |

### `modal-actions.close` props

| Prop name | Type | Description | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `label` | `string` | Defines the text to be rendered in the close button. This prop default value depends on the store's default language which is set according to the website's [binding](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/what-is-binding--4NcN3NJd0IeYccgWCI8O2W?locale=en).| `Cancel`, `Cancelar`, or `Cancelar` for stores whose default language is, respectively, English, Spanish or Portuguese.  |
